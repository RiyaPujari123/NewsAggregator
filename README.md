## API Key Usage
This project uses external APIs to fetch news articles (e.g., NewsAPI, The Guardian, NYT). Please note the following:

1. **API Key Limitations**: The API keys used in this project are **not subscription-based** and are subject to **rate limits** imposed by the respective API providers. 
   
2. **Rate Limits**: Each API provider has a rate limit on how many requests can be made within a specific time frame . Exceeding these limits may cause the API to temporarily block access.

3. **Usage Guidelines**:
   - If you plan to use the project extensively, you may need to **generate your own API key**.
   - Refer to the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/), or [NYT API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) documentation for information on how to obtain your own key.
